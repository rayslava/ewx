  <description summary="Let emacs manage wayland windows and input.">
    One ewp_layout client decides the layout for new surfaces (= windows).

    The wayland server sends the new_surface event on xdg_shell
    toplevel creation and creates a ewp_surface object.

    The layout client can then layout this ewp_surface object.

    in ewp:   ewp_layout             -> ewp_surface
    in emacs: client=events,requests -> wayland buffer

    ewp_layout object gets notified about new toplevel surfaces -> ewp_surface
